Special shout- out to Dalton & Clay , as they too, made it all a nice delivery as they were happy for us too , I was kept updated from the very beginning to the actual meeting. They called him Cody and that was nice, but to me this little Yorkshire Terrier was re-named \u201c Lil Willie \u201c He came to me healthy & very alert . He had been very well taken care of, I could tell. Thank- You Puppy Spot for this experience that changed my mind about how things could be, this was a beautiful one.

The drivers communicated the location and arrival time; they kept me updated with arrival eta status the whole time. I met them at the assigned location, we exchanged information to verify, and I picked up my little buddy. He was in great shape so I could tell they took very good care of him.

I'm sure he will be at least 18-20 lbs full grown, which I am ok with, but the accurate weight at the current time would have been the honest thing to communicate.

        "message": "The reason for this one star review is because of my experience with puppy spot. My experience with the actual breeder was great and we love our new puppy so much. She\u2019s perfect! This is our second puppy that we got through Puppy Spot. Everything went great with our first one (about 2.5 years ago), he was delivered to us by plane (in cabin with attendant) and then a driver brought him directly to our apartment. We didn\u2019t request this transport option, it was just what was automatically provided. \n\nWith this second puppy, the transport fee was about the same (about $700). I was told we would have to pick him up in a Target store parking lot about a 10-15 minute drive from our home. This was fine, but seemed odd so I started asking questions. I found out that this puppy would be coming by ground transport and the driver would have many puppies and many stops so had to pick an easier location to not slow down the route. And our puppy would be in her crate on this trip for 5 days. FIVE DAYS IN A CRATE!! The American Humane Society recommends having puppies in a crate for a maximum of four hours. And she would only be let out once every 12 hours for a few minutes while they changed the newspaper in her crate. She would not be allowed outside at any point in this five days. So - an energetic little puppy just taken from her home would be locked in a crate for 5 days mostly sitting in her own excrement.\n\nThere was no way I was letting this happen so I called puppy Spot for other options. They offered an option to fly her with an attendant, which would cost $2000, or else I could fly and pick her up myself. \n\nI chose to fly to come get her (4 flights in one day for a round trip from California to Arkansas and back). I sent over my proposed travel plans before booking, the breeder agreed to the date and time, and Puppy Spot told me to go ahead and book. After my flights were already booked, PS contacted me to tell me that the breeder was no longer available that day and we needed to switch to a new day. Since I had non refundable flights I said this wasn\u2019t possible. I was back and forth with various people from PS with this and was repeatedly told this was somehow my fault and I was responsible for covering any costs for booking new flights. It was so stressful and went on for days. Finally, PS agreed to cover the cost to change the flights (about $250), so I switched the trip to a new day. \n\nA few days after getting back home with our new puppy, I had not received the $250 reimbursement so I texted in the chat we\u2019d been discussing this in. The person who responded had no idea what I was talking about. So I called PS and they said they had no record and no notes of this. This happened multiple times in the past as well where it felt like I was starting from scratch each time I talked to someone new. And each time I was told in some way how this was my fault. Eventually they reviewed the text chat history and issued the reimbursement. But it was a fight and a hassle every step of the way. What a nightmare. And of all the stress, the worst was knowing that had I not asked any questions, our sweet little puppy would have been locked in a crate for 5 days before getting to us.",

I don't believe that they take good care of the puppies. The puppy will NOW receive all the love & security they failed to provide.

They kept me up to date on Jade and the whole process. The communication with the people from Puppy Spot was excellent. Jade was a little small to travel so we had to wait until she was 12 weeks old for her safety. During that time we received updates thru text and phone calls reassuring us that Jade was doing well, and the process was moving along. We received Jade on April 10th. She was suppose to arrive at the meeting place at 9:30 pm but i received at text from Premier Pet that they were running early and we could pick up Jade at 8:45 pm. We only had to drive 1 hour to the pick up place. When we were handed Jade we were concerned that she would be upset with the long ride or being separated from her mom and family. Not the case. She was a bundle of energy and even cuter that the pictures. The breeder must must have been working with her because she could fetch a ball and just loves being around new people. \n I highly recommend Puppy Spot for you next puppy. \nThank You\nJIm B",

Linda did change it to our cell numbers, however some how it didn't get thru to the transportation team.

The website worked very well in helping to identify the puppy we wanted. Now the negatives. She arrived little sick with a parasite - giardia. She barely ate the first day. I think the customer service could improve after the purchase. Puppy Spot sends a computer link that is supposed to allow the buyer to get information on their dog and the status of the transaction, delivery, etc. The representative I spoke with said the link probably wouldn't work and it didn't. This tells me the company may not care about getting it fixed. Maybe it's a cost issue. Also, I believe the sales rep told me the dog would arrive with a personal item like a blanket or toy to help with the trauma of separation and travel by van. Nothing came with Olive. Overall, very happy with our new puppy.",

She was knowledgeable about the different breeders and sent photos of the parents of multiple puppies, to help me visualize what the puppies might look like as adults. Needless to say, she helped us find the perfect puppy! And the drivers dropped him off less than 2 weeks later (the drivers were super nice and cleaned him up so that he was cute as a button). We love our new puppy! He is sweet, loveable, quiet, and already was sleeping through the nice in his crate on arrival. And our original PuppySpot puppy loves him to death.",

They sent us basically a puppy starter kit with harness, toys, leash, etc. They made transportation arrangements for us and then all was left was the wait. Which was only a couple weeks which was good it gave us time to puppy proof our home and purchase other items he needed for the day of pick up\nThe transporters contacted us about throughout the transport and have us updates. They actually arrived early for pick up so we were able to get him a little earlier from the pick up spot. The location is a public area and they do multiple drops at the same location so it's a general location that's equally close for all parties involved. We had a great experience and our puppy is happy and healthy. Thank you Puppy Spot for helping us bring home our newest family member Rocky \u2764\ufe0f. We picked him up on Wednesday 1/3/24. So he's only been home a couple of days and we have all fallen in love with him",

We've had 4 cockers previously during our marriage so we had certain expectations of the breed. We couldn't be happier. Our puppy is 5 1/2 months old, i purposely looked for a slightly older puppy, and he is acclimating well to his new home. He is basically house broken already, he gets along with my sons temperamental cat and is great with our 2 year old grandson, who wasn't really used to dogs. Even though he was vet certified before he was shipped, I took him to my own trusted vet who also gave him a clean bill of health and thought he had a wonderful temperament. It took 2 1/2 weeks til we received our puppy, which felt like forever, but the PuppySpot team kept us informed and responded to our texts and questions.",

I had done some research and decided that I wanted a hybrid or what is now known as a designer dog. The next thing I know, I found puppy spot and the most perfect Yorkiepoo named Mazie. Not familiar with adopting a dog online, I asked my dad for help. After using his engineering skills, my dad stumbled across the same site and the same puppy. \n\nPuppy spot knew I was cruising their site and before you know it, I got a text message from Lauren. That text message turned into a very long informative conversation where Lauren and I also bonded over our fur babies. Of course she also answered any and all of my questions, and made it all very clear and easy. Within 24 hours I had adopted her and the nervous excitement began. After all it had been almost 18 years since I had a puppy.\n\nAbout a week later, I drove 8 1/2 hours north to pick up this little girl in 20\u00b0 weather. There are no words. We took our time coming home but within the first 48 hours she had already stayed in a hotel, driven through three states, met all her checkmarks, been to a pet store, met her cat brother and sister, and even got a haircut. \n\nSince her adoption, Mazie has become Cali Marie and made herself a right at home. She cleared her first vet visit with flying colors and weighed in at a whole 5 pounds. \n\nPuppy spot made everything easy, but in an understandable manner. They also understood that adopting a new puppy was an experience. I was reminded of that experience when I got a care package delivered in the mail from puppy spot. I\u2019m very thankful for their support and everything they did to go above and beyond and make this the best experience. Thank you!",

She arrived in comfort in an MB Sprinter from IL to FL and was bathed and given a cute bow before they handed Henley, now Liberty, over to us. The transporter took great care of her along the way as she was calm and relaxed upon arrival. We had her at the vet this morning for her check up and she is 100% healthy. Again a testament to the breeder and the transporter. Puppy Spot did a great job vetting the breeder. This is my first experience with Puppy Spot. I highly recommend them to anyone who wants a first class puppy concierge.",

She actually slept through the night on the first night in her crate on the bed with us. It has been less than a week and she is already learning to go to the door to go outside to relieve herself. I can\u2019t say how happy we are with PuppySpot and we\u2019d definitely recommend the service to anyone who wishes to purchase a puppy. All can say is THANK YOU and keep up the good work.

That was before strolling one afternoon of Shihtzus. I was just trying to find some comfort in finding some alive Shihtzus.(My favorite) \nThere she was on my screen and seemed to be looking at me with those eyes and sweet face. My husband was called to see and both agree she is our baby we need and want.\n\nCalled and talked with Lisa at Puppy Spot. How professional and helpful with my questions and concerns. Next couple days\nI had more questions and concerns and was always assisted in a polite and helpful way.\nNEVER treated in a negative way. I was being put to ease \u201cThese people are the real thing, \nAnd can be trusted.\nWe received several emails up to and including news our new love Shihtzu was on the way home.\n\nOur transporters names were shared with dates and estimated times of arrival. We was notified that time was better than estimated .\nWe were so excited! Our transporters were friendly ,dependable, and more than willing to answer questions. I was thrilled and excited.\n\nMy whole experience from beginning to end with \u201cPuppy Spot\u201d went perfect for us . From an experience that could go so wrong - all went Sssooo right. We are grateful. We are thankful. You all are trustworthy and very dependable.\n\nYou are all that you say you are and keep on keeping on. .!!! I recommend you HIghly to all.\n\nI wanted to take this time and share . I would have been wrong if I did not, You all-including our Shihtzu breeder affiliated with .\u201dPuppy Spot\u201d is now being sung praises from me.\nThanks and appreciation \nPatricia",

Why she wasn't snapped up right away, I have no clue. four days with the two of us and she has provided so much joy, love, and laughter.\nThe process was easy. From what we read, we knew Lucy was for us! Without having to think about it, Lucy became a part of our family.\nAll communications with PuppySpot were wonderful and prepared us for this new experience. I was thrilled with all of the expectations placed on us to sort of qualify us. Thank you for doing that. If anything, we were over-prepared. We opted to drive the 15 hours one way to meet Lucy. The breeder met us on time at the pre-determined location.\nThe drive home took much longer than anticipated, but for the entire 20-hour drive home Lucy spent in our arms.\nThank you.

It was so easy to sort by breed and look through all the dogs and once I found our little guy it was as simple of clicking the \"bring me home\" button. \n\n I was able to speak to a real person on the phone with any questions. She had my order pulled up immediately, told me where my puppy was located and how long they had worked with the breeder. (locations etc are not on site for safety) then get a puppy specific code for the app (only once purchase. was complete) to track and communicate the entire process. There was plenty of communication so I never worried about what step or timing we were on. \nWe had our little guy transported by van to our state. I was given a cell number and got texts during the transport to reassure and update timing. Upon arrival we met at our local airport cell lot. There were multiple other people picking up their dogs. Providing an ID I was handed this fluffy little guy along with his paperwork and food. We are thrilled to have him in his forever home. I would absolutely work with puppy spot again if we were to get. another puppy in the future.",

I have to say the process of working with PuppySpot was very smooth and the whole transition was smooth and orderly. I had a small issue with the pup when I first received him . And the customer service team from PuppySpot was GREAT! if you\u2019re in the market for a new furry friend I recommend PuppySpot!!",

Everyone was very kind and supportive and we could tell our puppy had been socialized and well cared for. Our puppy\u2019s complete medical records were organized and available with pick-up.

In February, I decided to finally surprise her and it was the best thing I could\u2019ve done! PuppySpot was absolutely amazing to work with and they made the process so easy. I chose to have our pup delivered and the dog transporters were so friendly, and you can tell they take very good care of the fur babies they\u2019re transporting. The little care package sent by PuppySpot was a great touch too! It came with a dog bed, treats, toys and more! The perfect starter kit! My daughter named our new addition to the family Boomer, and they are inseparable. It is true love and an amazing bond. I can\u2019t recommend using PuppySpot enough!",

Once we proceeded forward we were updated via the PuppySpot app with our pup\u2019s specific ID from new pictures to health/travel info. What I didn\u2019t like is how she was transported, in an RV. I\u2019m saying that because the email stated they stop for puppy breaks being it\u2019s a 13 hour plus drive along with other pups. I will say the drivers were great with letting us know they were behind due to traffic, etc. when they took her out you saw all the crates of puppies stacked so right away i thought no way were there stops. Other than the transportation we waited about a week in between to get her and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. I HIGHLY suggest you get your puppy checked out within 7 days. Our lady girl had tapeworm, roundworm and giardia and that was found 4 days after we received her. PuppySpot does live up to their health commitment and covered the costs for treatment (medication, specific GI food and fecal sample). She is doing well and much better. I would recommend PuppySpot if you\u2019re looking for a specific purebred companion anywhere else I looked they were mixed but was told purebred. And of course they the heath commitment is a major plus.",

But American Airlines sucked, they were worst than terrible. 1) My Beagle was bumped from one flight to another because of weather and when I inquired what flight and time she would be on they told me \"You'll get her, when you get her\". Then they hung-up on me. 2) Once my Beagle got to the Grand Rapids Airport, an Airline Employee carried her to the office to and placed the carrier inside the door so I could my paperwork. Then this \"Karen\" lost it stating the dog does not belong in the \"open air\" office, she hates dogs, etc. The Airline Employee who carried her picked up the crate and moved it outside of the office. This guy was great understanding and great employee. Well back to \"Karen\", she's still screaming and carrying on like an fool. I asked her for my paperwork, she threw the paperwork at me, I picked it up, got my dog and went home.",

Make sure to download the App, it\u2019s very helpful. The crate they shipped our puppy in was packed with a lot of newspaper shredding so that he was comfortable. They also had a water and food dish attached to the front on the crate for him to eat from if he was hungry/thirsty. The care package they send you for your puppy is full of high quality items and I was happily surprised with the amount of toys they sent.

The customer service with Leira was awesome, she sent us photos of Sailor's parents that we requested and answered every question and concern immediately. When we asked to change the date to pick up Sailor in Indiana sooner, communication was a bit slow with that team, however, I called the Management number, and spoke with KC who was a delight and who was able to get all the details ironed out for us right away. Leira and KC made our experience extremely easy and worry free.The day we drove to Shipshawana, Indiana to meet the breeder, I asked him if he would be so kind as to send us a photo of Sailor (who was originally named Henderson) and his litter mates, he sent us not one, but four of the most adorable photos with his three brothers. It touched our hearts beyond words, and we will forever treasure these photos! Thank you Puppy Spot for arranging for us to add our sweet little Sailor to our family. He has been a complete joy so far, and will be even more joyful once he is finsihed teething! We couldn't love our two Puppy Spot Boys more!!!!",

We ended up having to drive quite a distance to an airport which was not the closest airport making for an extra long day for a puppy that had traveled for many hours and a dangerous winter drive for us.

I'm wicked proud of myself and my golden doodle for been patient with me when I didn't understand his signs when he needed to go, or when he wanted to play and I took it as he was misbehaving.

She was clean, happy and was in the arms of a human being cuddled & loved instead of in a crate all alone and terrified. She is in amazing health (per our Veterinarian) and she even knew to use to potty pad on the first day home. She is even softer and cuter than the photos showed! We couldn't be more thrilled to have our family complete and we recommend PuppySpot to everyone now. With he first vet visit free & a few free telehealth visits, along with detailed records & microchip, the money spent starts to make sense very quickly! 10/10 recommend.",

Puppy Spot came highly recommended by some of our new friends here. The website was so easy to navigate and the photos and puppy descriptions where great. I went on the site and found \"Darla Sue\", who my wife renamed \"Bailey\". Linda, the Puppy Spot representative was great. She helped me with the whole process. I surprised my wjfe and when she saw the photos she was so happy. When Bailey arrived by plane with a Puppy Spot chaperone my wife was so excited. Bailey is a beautiful, happy, and healthy little lady. She truly turned our beautiful new house into a beautiful new home.

Pup was to arrive 9/8/22 nothing was ever mentioned about being late, then the evening of 9/7/22 I checked our app and the date was changed to a week out.....well damn I took the day off work to join my wife to pick up the puppy. On 9/10/22 I was notified he wouldn't arrive until 9/15/22. Which he did....my wife fell in love instantly and she bonded with the little guy on the drive home. He has been the greatest companion for my wife on her walks. When he arrived he was just 12 wks. old and 10.5#. He is now 18 wks 27.5# and just the greatest dog I have ever known. Other than the one hiccup at the time of delivery our communication was straight forward and informative. We chose our puppy, got him reserved and completed the transaction quickly and easily, Linda F. Helped us go through it all and answered all of our questions. After that it was just the waiting and anticipation, preparing our home for him. \"Tank\" has stolen our hearts and he is totally devoted to us. Our vet had never seen a Bernedoodle so he is always the center of attention. We can't Thank Puppy Spot enough for providing the chance for us to choose our perfect puppy.\"Tank\" is a standard Sable colored male Bernedoodle....we are expecting him to be close to 100# when full grown. 1st picture 2nd day home Mary Ann & Tank - 12 wks old. 2nd picture Terry & Tank - 18 wks.

I could tell he was sorry. He snuggled up to me for a few hours. I'm wheelchair redden at the moment. I will walk in the near future. Macho has basically almost stopped. We have a Shiba Inu also. She will be 7 on December 12th. She loves him. The two of them play all day long. They sleep 3 to 4 times a day. We love them both. He has no separation anxiety because of Sheba. The 26th of this month he'll be 4 months older. He knows some knowledge of obedience. Someone must have taught him. Part of my training is done. Thank You. Have a great day.

No wait lists, lots of choices and you get to pick the puppy you want. They do take a while to get back to you when you contact them for questions but that\u2019s only because they\u2019re busy assisting so many people with getting their fur babies home safe and sound. They always responded to my many, many questions and everyone I spoke to was kind and accommodating. You can tell they really care about what they are doing. My puppy came via ground and was delivered to me by Rusty. He let me know if there were any updates on the time and picking Haven (now named Amren) up was seamless. The breeder did a fantastic job with her. I only wish she had provided me with her contact info so I can thank her properly! My puppy is gorgeous, healthy, full of love and has SO much energy! If you were like me and think that PuppySpot sounds too good to be true, trust in the process and take the leap! Thank you so much to the wonderful team at PuppySpot for helping me find my new best friend! My heart is so full, I could not be happier!",

Tails and Whiskey.\n\nWe also purchased the puppy kit with toys, bowls, bed, etc for both dogs. Even a year apart we received the EXACT SAME items.

I initially selected the two females then three days later decided to keep all together and claimed the male. They arrived healthy, happy and have had no issues adjusting to their new environment. PuppySpot provided so much information and photos on their development over the three weeks before they were able to be released , on different Pet Insurances, and care to be given upon arrival as they were to be flown into Logan. Due to high temperatures they were instead transported by van and had individual attention the two days it took. They arrived healthy and happy with tails wagging furiously. No scams, no heavy sales techniques, just caring concern. I have since recommended PuppySpot to several people and I hope they will find the same caring and respect I found in this Agency.\n\n MaryEllen Lowes",

It is a little nerve racking since you can\u2019t communicate with the breeder directly (I am used to doing this as I\u2019ve never used this type of forum before) but my situation was most likely not typical I needed a couple weeks due to work schedule prior to picking up our puppy. Staff was kind and patient and wiling to answer questions. Everything worked out perfectly in the end. My advice be patient the world is understaffed and the people at puppy staff work hard and they do a wonderful job. Thank you for helping me find Gustav, for your transparency and patience. He is such an amazing addition to our family. We are so in love with him. Also this particular breeder is incredible. Only suggestion is if we could leave a rating for the breeder. Would be nice if people searching for GSD could know that the breeder is exceptional. Thank you again for helping us puppy spot!",

We found PuppySpot with great reviews, and instantly fell in love with a Cavapoo named Rayban posted on the site. We sent the request for information and within a couple of hours received a call from a Puppy Agent (Lisa Rasuly) to tell us more about Rayban. We decided that night to reserve and purchase Rayban. The process was fast and the PS app gave us updates we needed, even a new video from the breeder per our request. The travel date was set for July 21st (call and email from Emerson, the Puppy Manager), and even though that was just quick 3 weeks, it felt forever to get our very first fur baby! The day came with step by step updates from the American Airlines tracker. He came on time, waiting for us at the cargo area pickup. Rayban (now called Chico) is home! He has completed our family!",

I also communicated with her after the puppy\u2019s arrival to thank her, and she went above and beyond to forward this note to the breeder, and I received a very kind response in return. The PuppySpot team that arranged the travel were excellent as well. They were very responsive in communicating instructions. I also can't say enough about the transport crew \u2013 they were exceptional! We had text updates along the way and it was obvious that all of the puppies were well cared for. The puppies arrived via ground transport as opposed to air travel. They were late because of traffic, but all I honestly cared about was that my puppy arrived safely, and he did. They kept in constant contact with a group of us to let us know how all of the puppies were doing as well as their anticipated ETA. There were just a couple of glitches that are preventing me from providing a 5-star review: The in-between phase after the initial sale was a little frustrating. There were automated responses and instructions were unclear. This got better later in the process when we were able to connect to an actual human. The other setback is that our puppy developed Giardia within a few days after arriving, which resolved with treatment. All in all, it was a fantastic experience and I would recommend them. Our new beagle puppy is amazing!",

Puppy Spot walked me through the process, were readily available to answer any questions, kept me abreast of any updates on my puppy and I had access to videos and photos that were uploaded by the breeder while I awaited my puppy's arrival to our home.

I was out of town, responded to the email that I wouldn\u2019t be home until Friday, and sent a text with the same detail. On Thursday, while traveling for work, I received a call from the pet transport company saying they were at my house. Not sure where the disconnect was, they told me someone needed to come retrieve the puppy within 15 min or they would have to ship him back to WI and re-deliver the following week. I scrambled to find someone to drive across town midday to retrieve him. Not the best experience or communication, but Yogi is amazing and brings joy everyday.",
