My parents say that they were taught to shake so that they can participate in important business dealings. Maybe someday, I\u2019ll be promoted by my very own human to do the same. I have become aware that there are many different kinds of food. The first being a sort of dehydrated brown niblet, the second being a kind of wet food which I have come to understand is so special that they keep it in little armored cans that no paw or claw can penetrate; and then all of the other food is anything and everything the humans are eating. This last type of food is sacred, as it is always just a bit out of reach and the humans do not always share. Maybe you as my human, will share all with me.",

I am told that I am very smart, sweet, and playful. I love to watch what you do very attentively. Spending time with you will make me the happiest puppy ever! Sometimes I feel the need to give you puppy kisses! I prefer to kiss your nose, as there is something so funny about human noses; they make me giggle. I also really enjoy chasing my tail. I don't know what that thing does back there, but it intrigues me. I have yet to catch it, but I'll keep trying. I am looking for a family that will love and spoil me, as long as you let me spoil you with my love too. I think you could be the one for me!",

I can lay there for hours soaking up every bit of affection. If you want to earn some doggie brownie points from me, then don't forget to rub my belly! I can't wait to meet my new family and go on all sorts of adventures. I have a whole lot of love to give, and I want to spend every moment I can with you! Before I leave for my new home, I'm going to see my vet to make sure I'm healthy and current on vaccinations. I've got to go now, but I hope to join my new family soon, so that I can spend every day loving them!",
