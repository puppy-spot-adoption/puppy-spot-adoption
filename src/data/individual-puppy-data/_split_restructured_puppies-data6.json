We could also just cuddle up on the couch to a good movie and some popcorn, or doggy treats in my case.

I am socialized and bred to have an excellent temperament. I will come complete with non-stop kisses and devotion in return for your love. I am working hard on my outdoor potty training skills and I will be up to date on vaccinations and vet checks. To be perfectly honest with you, I am raised inside so I am used to the normal sounds of a home that will be just like when I live with you. Most of all, I am like royalty, you see, I am just the right size; I will be small enough to go with you everywhere yet when I'm all grown up, I'll be big enough to safely get on and off the furniture. In summary, I hope that you call soon to bring me home because I have already started packing my bags. I am excited to meet my new family! Time will fly, don't miss out.",
