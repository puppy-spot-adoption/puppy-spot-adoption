I have become aware that there are many different kinds of food. The first being a sort of dehydrated brown niblet, the second being a kind of wet food which I have come to understand is so special that they keep it in little armored cans that no paw or claw can penetrate; and then all of the other food is anything and everything the humans are eating. This last type of food is sacred, as it is always just a bit out of reach and the humans do not always share. Maybe you as my human, will share all with me.",

My parents say that they were taught to shake so that they can participate in important business dealings. Maybe someday, I\u2019ll be promoted by my very own human to do the same. I have become aware that there are many different kinds of food. The first being a sort of dehydrated brown niblet, the second being a kind of wet food which I have come to understand is so special that they keep it in little armored cans that no paw or claw can penetrate; and then all of the other food is anything and everything the humans are eating. This last type of food is sacred, as it is always just a bit out of reach and the humans do not always share. Maybe you as my human, will share all with me.",

Spending time with you will make me the happiest puppy ever! Sometimes I feel the need to give you puppy kisses! I prefer to kiss your nose, as there is something so funny about human noses; they make me giggle. I also really enjoy chasing my tail. I don't know what that thing does back there, but it intrigues me. I have yet to catch it, but I'll keep trying. I am looking for a family that will love and spoil me, as long as you let me spoil you with my love too. I think you could be the one for me!",

I have been known to catch a ball or two, long walks tickle my fancy, and fetch is just about my favorite pastime. Playtime aside, I have also been known to indulge in a good, old-fashioned nap and I sure hope that you'll snuggle up with me. To top it all off, my vet says that I am super healthy and all ready to go. I mean, what more could you ask for? I can't wait to meet you so we can start making great memories together.

They would like to spend lots of time outside soaking up all the sun and play time that they can get. Having fun is very, very important. They would also like yummy food. The more puppy treats they'd be willing to give me, the better. My perfect family would also like to take a nap every now and then. That way, we can recharge and be ready for more fun later on. Most importantly, they would be ready to love a puppy like me. I want to be everything that you could dream of in a puppy if you just give me that chance. I hope to hear from my perfect family soon!
