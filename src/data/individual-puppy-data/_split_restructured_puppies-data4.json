My parents say that they were taught to shake so that they can participate in important business dealings. Maybe someday, I\u2019ll be promoted by my very own human to do the same. I have become aware that there are many different kinds of food. The first being a sort of dehydrated brown niblet, the second being a kind of wet food which I have come to understand is so special that they keep it in little armored cans that no paw or claw can penetrate; and then all of the other food is anything and everything the humans are eating. This last type of food is sacred, as it is always just a bit out of reach and the humans do not always share. Maybe you as my human, will share all with me.",

I can lay there for hours soaking up every bit of affection. If you want to earn some doggie brownie points from me, then don't forget to rub my belly! I can't wait to meet my new family and go on all sorts of adventures. I have a whole lot of love to give, and I want to spend every moment I can with you! Before I leave for my new home, I'm going to see my vet to make sure I'm healthy and current on vaccinations.
