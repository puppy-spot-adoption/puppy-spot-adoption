He is also quite vocal, expressing himself in the funniest ways, especially when he thinks his brothers might beat him to the milk bar. Beyond his playful antics, Ralphie often shows his sensitive side when he cuddles up next to us for some snugly time. It truly melts our hearts. As a part of our commitment to responsible breeding, each of our puppies undergoes genetic testing through Embark. This ensures that Ralphie will be healthy over time and provides valuable information about his size, weight, and health, which is essential for your veterinarian. If you're looking for a unique holiday gift, consider one of our Bernedoodle puppies.",

He comes home with his registration papers, pedigree, and his very own care package which includes his first toy, a blanket that smells familiar to him, and more. Since Akie's parents are our pets; we raise our puppies in our home and start working on potty training skills before they leave for their forever homes. They get ample socialization with our family and the stimulus of playing with toys and listening to the sounds of our home.  Akie is packed with a wonderful personality, is a show-stopper, and will come pre-spoiled!",

Farkas is full of personality; while he can be pretty frisky and energetic, he also knows how to enjoy his calm moments, making him an outstanding balance of playful and lazy. His goofy nature often leads him into amusing situations, and even after a long day of play, he\u2019s always ready for the next adventure. He loves to snuggle and relax, especially when flipped on his back, showcasing his friendly and tolerant demeanor. This makes him a great companion for children and other pets. Our puppies undergo genetic testing through Embark, which assures you that the puppy will be healthy over time, provides a reasonable estimate of size, weight, and furnishings, and gives your veterinarian important health information. If you're looking for a unique holiday gift, consider one of our Bernedoodle puppies.",

If you want to stay at home, we can play out in the yard, and I can even teach you how to play fetch! It's easy, I promise. We could also just cuddle up on the couch to a good movie and some popcorn, or doggy treats in my case. Before coming home to you, I will even be up to date on my puppy vaccinations and I will be vet checked, so we can get right to the good stuff once I get there.
