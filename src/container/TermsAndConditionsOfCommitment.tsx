		        <p style={{textAlign: "center", padding: '1rem 0'}}>(For puppies purchased on or after 9.1.2022)</p>
		<p>Before bringing a puppy home, PuppySpot Group, LLC (“PuppySpot”) wants you to know that owning a puppy means frequent visits to a veterinarian and that you will be responsible for all costs associated with such veterinarian visits.</p>
		<p>At PuppySpot, we do everything we can to make sure your puppy is as healthy as possible when s/he arrives, but puppies are living breathing animals which means health issues do arise from time to time. Our health issue commitment as provided below is contingent on you buying a pet insurance policy on your puppy for the entire first six months of his/her life</p>

		<h2 style={{padding: '1rem 0'}}>What is our commitment?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
		<p>Before your puppy comes home he or she has undergone an extensive veterinary health check and his/her breeder has followed our vaccination and deworming protocols. This commitment covers health issues that may arise after the arrival of your puppy. This commitment only covers puppies who are delivered and have continually resided within the United States and/or Canada.</p>
		<ol className="sublist">
		<li><em>Days 1-14:</em> If, within 14 days of arrival, your puppy is found to have a contagious disease, illness, or parasite, PuppySpot will provide you with reimbursement of reasonable and customary veterinary bills to treat such condition up to the purchase price of your puppy upon presentation to PuppySpot of such bills within 21 days of the arrival of your puppy. This subsection 1 does not require that you have any pet insurance.</li>
		<li><em>Year 1:</em> If within one year from the date of arrival from PuppySpot, your dog is found and certified by two duly licensed doctors of veterinary medicine (any reference herein to a “veterinarian” shall be assumed to mean a “licensed doctor of veterinary medicine”) of your choosing to have a congenital or hereditary condition which adversely affects the health of the dog in any material respect, and you notify PuppySpot in writing of such condition within five business days of the first veterinarian’s determination of the condition, PuppySpot will provide reimbursement of reasonable, documented, actually incurred veterinary expenses associated with such diagnosed condition up to the purchase price of your puppy.</li>
		<li><em>Years 2-10:</em> For all breeds EXCEPT English Bulldogs, if, between the first and tenth anniversary of the date of arrival, your dog is found and certified by two veterinarians of your choosing to have a congenital or hereditary condition which adversely affects the health of your dog in any material respect, and you notify PuppySpot in writing within five business days of the first veterinarian’s determination of the condition, PuppySpot shall, &nbsp;upon presentation of reasonable, documented, actually incurred veterinary expenses associated with such diagnosed condition, at your option, either (i) issue a credit equal to fifty percent (50%) of the purchase price of your puppy, to be used toward the purchase of another puppy from PuppySpot &nbsp;(ii) reimburse you for your actually incurred veterinary expenses associated with such diagnosed condition, up to twenty-five percent of the original purchase price of your puppy.</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
		<h2 style={{padding: '1rem 0'}}>What is not covered?</h2>
		<p>The following are not covered by this commitment:</p>
		<ol className="sublist">

		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
		<h2 style={{padding: '1rem 0'}}>Hypoglycemia is also not covered</h2>
		<p className="p1"><span className="s1">All puppies, and especially small breed puppies 5lbs or under, are susceptible to hypoglycemia.&nbsp; Also known as low blood sugar, hypoglycemia is characterized by:&nbsp;</span></p>
		<ul className="ul1">
		<li className="li2"><span className="s2"></span><span className="s3">Low energy&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li className="li2"><span className="s4"></span><span className="s3">Little to no appetite&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li className="li2"><span className="s4"></span><span className="s3">Lethargy&nbsp;</span></li>
		</ul>
		<ul className="ul1">
		<li className="li2"><span className="s4"></span><span className="s3">Overly hot – or cold – body temperature&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li className="li2"><span className="s4"></span><span className="s3">Vomiting and/or diarrhea&nbsp;</span></li>
		</ul>
		<p className="p3"><span className="s1">To avoid hypoglycemia, it is important to make sure the puppy is on a proper- and monitored - feeding schedule. Especially during the first two weeks in a new home. A change in environment is a form of stress to a puppy new in a home, and this can be seen in improper eating.&nbsp; Always keep food available during the first couple weeks at home until the puppy is observed to be eating regularly.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p className="p3"><span className="s1">Additionally, the steps to avoid hypoglycemia include feeding the puppy a sugar supplement like Nutri-Cal, Nutri-Stat, karo syrup or processed honey to kick start a proper appetite. This is not a replacement for proper food, merely a way to provide the temporary energy needed to resume eating. This can be done by:&nbsp;</span></p>
		<ul className="ul1">
		<li className="li2"><span className="s2"></span><span className="s3">Putting the supplement on a finger to have the puppy lick it off&nbsp;</span></li>
		</ul>
		<ul className="ul1">
		<li className="li2"><span className="s4"></span><span className="s3">Rubbing supplement on the puppy’s tongue, gums or roof of the mouth&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li className="li2"><span className="s4"></span><span className="s3">Ensuring the puppy swallows&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li className="li2"><span className="s4"></span><span className="s3">Supplement can also be administered by syringe, much like feeding a human baby.&nbsp;</span></li>
		</ul>
		<p className="p1"><span className="s1">As hypoglycemia is not considered an infectious issue nor hereditary or congenital in nature, cases of hypoglycemia are not covered by our Health Commitment. Ensuring a puppy eats properly and regularly is paramount to the ongoing health of a puppy and is solely the responsibility of the puppy’s owner.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7Smcj6RCr8"><span className="s5">We strongly encourage all PuppySpot customers to be familiar with our video about hypoglycemia.</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<h2 style={{padding: '1rem 0'}}>What are your obligations?</h2>
		<p>YOU MUST FULFILL THESE OBLIGATIONS, AS EXPLAINED HEREIN, OR THIS HEALTH COMMITMENT WILL TERMINATE AND BECOME NULL AND VOID.</p>
		<p>a. &nbsp; &nbsp;In order to make a claim, you must provide PuppySpot with &nbsp;proof of pet insurance from our partner, Fetch Pet Insurance, or another major medical pet insurance provider at the time that you make such claim which demonstrates that the insurance policy was in force for at least six (6) months from your puppy’s arrival. &nbsp;In the event that the pet insurance is cancelled for any reason during this six month period, PuppySpot’s commitment as provided herein shall terminate and be null and of no force and effect.</p>
		<p>b. &nbsp; &nbsp;You must also ensure that your puppy has timely vet visits and complete medical records evidencing these visits shall be provided to PuppySpot in the event you wish to exercise this PuppySpot commitment.&nbsp;</p>
		Additionally, we strongly encourage all responsible new puppy owners to take their puppy to the vet as close to arrival as safely possible. This can include telemedicine visits which are a great way to get immediate access to a vet without waiting. This will allow your vet to get to know your new puppy's vaccine schedule and get a care program started. This is also a recommendation as your new pup will have just changed environments from breeder to your home. Getting a checkup right away helps the transition go as smoothly as possible.<em></em>
		<ol className="sublist">
		<li><em>No Vaccines for 10 Days:</em> Your puppy will arrive up to date on vaccinations. To avoid over-vaccination, you should not vaccinate the puppy within the first ten (10) days after your puppy's arrival.</li>
		<li><em>No Dog Parks and other places where puppy will mingle with unknown dogs: </em>Puppies without a complete set of vaccinations should &nbsp; &nbsp;not be attend a dog park until such vaccinations are completed. &nbsp;This typically occurs at 16 weeks of age.</li>
		<li><em>Regular Veterinary Care:</em> You must visit a licensed veterinarian on a regular basis and ensure your dog receives proper health checkups and timely inoculations.</li>
		<li><em>Appropriate exercise:</em> All dogs need regular exercise and stimulation. You should speak to your veterinarian about the appropriate amount of exercise for your breed of puppy at each stage of its life. In particular, you should be careful to avoid over-exercising your puppy during its growth period.</li>
		<li><em>Healthy Diet:</em> Your puppy will arrive with information about the type of food it has been fed so far [and a small amount of that food]. If you plan to transition to a new food, you should do so gradually to allow your puppy a chance to acclimate to the new food. You should follow a recommended nutritional program, including feeding only premium dog foods and veterinarian approved supplements. You should be careful not to under or over feed your puppy and, in particular, if your puppy's breed is prone to hip dysplasia be careful not to over-feed your dog.</li>
		<li><em>No breeding:</em> Your puppy is intended to be a companion dog; do not breed your dog. If your dog is bred, this health commitment shall terminate and become null and void. Your puppy should be spayed or neutered at an age deemed appropriate by your veterinarian.</li>
		<li><span data-contrast="none" className="TextRun SCXW36002387 BCX0"><span className="NormalTextRun SCXW36002387 BCX0">Pet insurance: For all issues that arise, we will require proof that you have raised a claim with your insurance provider.
